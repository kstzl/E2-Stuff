                                and also some history too:
 ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	Hey there!
	I wrote the first lines of this little toy back in July of 2010 when learning the magix of Expression2.
	With the intention of stuffing every possible ability I could into one single chip a created the
assistant as a tool for my day to day Garry's Mod needs.
	As its popularity began to increasce I remained concerned with the minge-magnitude that could be unleashed
with it. It was in early 2011 that I finally decided to release the source code and unlock the anti-dupe protection
I had built into the chip.
	As of now you are able to receive updates as they are released on git, directly into the assistant embeded code updater, you are also free to share and edit it under the terms of the General Public License version 2.
	I hope you have fun with this simple toy. As some users have already done, feel free to email me with any questions you might have. Even tho it has been years since I coded into the assistant, I still enjoy helping people using it.

> The small percentage of the code I didnt write is credited in the Command List Below.

> 25% of the maxquota is a lot while idle, I know. I dont know how to decreasce that without deletting half of the code. Feel free to share if you have any method of making it more efficient in that regard.
